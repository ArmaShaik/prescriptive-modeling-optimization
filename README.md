# üçΩÔ∏è Prescriptive Modeling: Meal Plan Optimization

This project demonstrates a **Mixed Integer Programming (MIP)** optimization model built using **Pyomo** and the **CBC solver** in Python. I developed an optimization model that creates **cost-effective and balanced weekly meal plans** (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and fruit) that meet specific nutritional guidelines. The solution is ideal for individuals or institutions looking to **optimize meal planning** while staying healthy and budget-friendly.

## üîç Project Summary

I built an MIP model that helps design a 7-day meal plan using a combination of breakfasts, lunches, dinners, and fruits while:

- Satisfying **daily nutritional requirements** (calories, protein, carbs and fat)
- **Minimizing total cost** across the entire week
- Ensuring variety across meals
- Avoiding repetition of the same food item multiple times a day

The model outputs a personalized meal plan that is not only **nutritionally balanced** but also **cost-efficient**. It can easily be adapted for **personal use, institutional meal planning**, or even **diet-restricted programs**.

## üß† Optimization Model

**Objective:**  
Minimize total meal cost over the week.

**Decision Variables:**

- `x1[day, breakfast]` ‚Üí 1 if a specific breakfast is chosen on a given day  
- `x2[day, meal, lunch/dinner]` ‚Üí 1 if a specific lunch or dinner is chosen on a given day  
- `y[day, fruit]` ‚Üí 1 if a specific fruit is selected on a given day

**Constraints:**

- Exactly one breakfast, lunch, dinner, and fruit per day  
- Total daily intake must meet minimum nutrition requirements for calories, protein, fiber, etc.  
- Avoids food repetition across the same day  
- Limits sugar and sodium intake to healthy thresholds
